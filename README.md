Take open data from some portals (like Tilastokeskus https://statfin.stat.fi/PxWeb/pxweb/en/StatFin/) and use different visualization techniques to give a user additional information. Make sure that the application is usable with both desktop and mobile screens. You can for example try some / all of the following:
Municipality elections
Show on map which party won in which municipality
Visualize how the power of parties have changed over the years on some municipality (user can of course select the one)
Visualize employment/unemployment rates on various places
Does that correlate with age distribution, educational level, or political parties?
Do the magic you really want to do with the data! Show how cool charts and maps it is possible to build with the tools introduced in the course or you can of course use some other tools if you see fit!
